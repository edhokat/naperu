            <p class="home-para">The foundation of the Australia Cricket Academy was laid by david warner with the sole aim of providing quality cricket training, world-class cricketing infrastructure, and opportunity to learn from experts in the field of cricket through a fun and innovative environment.n March 2018, following a preliminary investigation into ball tampering by the Australian team in the third match of their Test series against South Africa, Warner was suspended and charged with bringing the game into disrepute.[2] Following a board meeting later in the month, Cricket Australia banned Warner from all international and domestic cricket in Australia for one year, and from any leadership positions permanentlyOn 29 November 2008, Warner hit his first domestic One Day century for New South Wales with a score of 165* against Tasmania at Hurstville Oval in Sydney. This innings got him the record of the highest one day score by a Blues player.[10] In the reverse fixture at Hobart, he backed it up with a 54-ball 97 to narrowly miss the record for the fastest ever century in Australian domestic cricket.
